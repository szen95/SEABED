# SEABED
The repository for the SEABED project. SEABED stands for SEgmentation And Biomarker Enrichment of Differential treatment response.

Our manuscript, titled "Defining subpopulations of differential drug response to reveal novel target populations", describes our work and is now available at [npj Systems Biology and Applications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-019-0113-4).

### Workflow

This file covers the steps to get from the public data (Supplementary Table S4) to the segmented subpopulations and the relevant biomarkers generated (Supplementary Table S5) by SEABED.

The scripts are named as they are used.

1. Input data is available from Supplementary Table S4

2. Segmentation code
* `PoetSegmentationCode`

3. Feature enrichment to nominate biomarkers
* `nominate_biomarker.R`

4. Classification of pair-wise drug responses
* `drug_pair_classification.R`

5. Visualization of pair-wise drug responses
* `heatmap.py` takes the matrix in `MAPK_AKT_drug-drug_matrix.csv` (this is found in `example_inputs`) and creates a heatmap that shows the distinct drug response types.
*  The relevant files to generate the supplementary website are `index.html` and in the folder `website_s1`.
* The SEABED supplementary website can be found [here](https://szen95.github.io/SEABED/).  
* This is based from information and code available from https://github.com/PBrockmann/heatmap. Last accessed October 4, 2019. 

6. 2-D visualization of drug response profiles
* `scatter_plot.py` takes the output data after segmentation and creates a scatter plot showing the differential drug response of the subpopulations.
* It also annotates subpopulations with significantly enriched biomarker(s).

7. Tree diagram visualization of subpopulations
* To generate tree diagrams, call the `create_tree` method in `tree_diagram.py`. This creates tree diagrams showing the hierarchical sequence in how the subpopulations are formed during the segmentation process.
* `create_tree_image.py` and `modify_tree_image.py` are used to customize the appearance of the tree diagram, including the parent and terminal nodes.
