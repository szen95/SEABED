# SEABED
The repository for the SEABED project. SEABED stands for SEgmentation And Biomarker Enrichment for defining Differential drug response.

### Workflow

This file covers the steps to get from the public data files (Table S2) to the segmented subpopulations and the relevant biomarkers generated (Table S3) by SEABED.

The scripts are named as they are used.

1. Get the data (from GDSC, CCLE, CTRP) via Table S2 
2. Segmentation code 
3. Feature enrichment to nominate biomarkers
4. Classification of pair-wise drug responses
5. Visualization of pair-wise drug responses
6. 2-D visualization of drug response profiles
7. Tree visualization of subpopulations
